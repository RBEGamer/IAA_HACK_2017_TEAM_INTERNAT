# THE LIGHTBAR
For the user notification, we have decided to use some led warning lights.
The requirements for this light is, that the user can be notifiy in different colors and the left and right side should be controlled seperatly. The simplest solution are the WS2812 leds, so its possible control each led with a single dataline.
The controller in our case is the  ESP8266 board. The first idea is to control the lights over a udp/wifi connection.
But we had a time problem, so we used a simple serial connection nad the python-serial package.
